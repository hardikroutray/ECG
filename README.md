# ECG
Classify various cardiovascular conditions from Electrocardiogram (ECG) images[1]. The long term goal is to identify potential cardiac injury in patients due to COVID-19 from ECG data and also study the possible effects of SARS-CoV 2 variants on cardiac health. A recently developed tool using ML by JHU researchers does real-time prediction of cardiovascular complications in hospitalized patients with COVID-19. [2]

There also exists a kaggle pre-processed dataset for classifying arrythmias[3]. We may or may not need to process our data similar to the one on kaggle. We may add this data to the proposed analysis if feasible. Here is the state-of-the-art arrythmia detection paper using the kaggle dataset co-authored by Andrew Ng [4]
