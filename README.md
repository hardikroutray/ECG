# ECG

We classify various cardiovascular conditions from Electrocardiogram (ECG) images [1]. We also study the ECG of COVID-19 patients to identify potential cardiac injury due to SARS CoV 2. We perform both image and time series classification. Our 1D CNN model using time series achieves 95 % accuracy in classifying cardiac disorders including COVID-19.
